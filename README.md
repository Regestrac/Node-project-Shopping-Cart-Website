# Shopping-Cart-Website
This is a Web Development project of E-Commerse application.

In this project I have used Handlebars, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB.

This is just a simple shopping cart website that has an admin pannel which has the option to Add, Edit & Delete new products which are saved to the database.
The user has option to Signup, Login, veiw the product and its details, add produts to cart, view the cart and make changes in the cart and also orders.
